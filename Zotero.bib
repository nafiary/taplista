Based on MySQL master-slave replication technology, this system implements real-time synchronization of data and automatic switching between master and slave database servers, which ensures the high availability of database when master database fails, meanwhile, by using logical backup technology which combines full backup with incremental backup, this system achieves full recovery of data to ensure the high reliability of database when data misuse occurs.},

	abstract = {As companies shift from desktop applications to cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) applications deployed on public clouds, the competition for end-users by cloud providers offering similar services grows. In order to survive in such a competitive market, cloud-based companies must achieve good quality of service (QoS) for their users, or risk losing their customers to competitors. However, meeting the QoS with a cost-effective amount of resources is challenging because workloads experience variation overtime. This problem can be solved with proactive dynamic provisioning of resources, which can estimate the future need of applications in terms of resources and allocate them in advance, releasing them once they are not required. In this paper, we present the realization of a cloud workload prediction module for SaaS providers based on the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. We introduce the prediction based on the ARIMA model and evaluate its accuracy of future workload prediction using real traces of requests to Web servers. We also evaluate the impact of the achieved accuracy in terms of efficiency in resource utilization and QoS. Simulation results show that our model is able to achieve an average accuracy of up to 91 percent, which leads to efficiency in resource utilization with minimal impact on the QoS.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a decentralized probabilistic method for performance optimization of cloud services. We focus on Infrastructure-as-a-Service where the user is provided with the ability of configuring virtual resources on demand in order to satisfy specific computational requirements. This novel approach is strongly supported by a theoretical framework based on tail probabilities and sample complexity analysis. It allows not only the inclusion of performance metrics for the cloud but the incorporation of security metrics based on cryptographic algorithms for data storage. To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first unified approach to provision performance and security on demand subject to the Service Level Agreement between the client and the cloud service provider. The quality of the service is guaranteed given certain values of accuracy and confidence. We present some experimental results using the Amazon Web Services, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service to validate our probabilistic optimization method.},

	abstract = {Internet is growing at an alarming rate, and Web applications have permeated every aspect of people's life. Cloud computing provides a powerful computing model that allows users to access resources on-demand and pay as they use. Cloud computing attracts an increasing number of developers to migrate their Web applications to cloud platforms. Cloud platforms should provide elasticity ability to change the amount of resources allocated to a Web application in order to meet the actual varying demands because of the changing workload. In this paper, we design and implement DoCloud which is an elastic cloud platform based on Docker. In DoCloud, we adopt adding or removing Docker containers to change a Web application's resource and we build a hybrid elasticity controller that incorporates proactive model and reactive model for scale out coupled with proactive model for scale in. Our experiments show that DoCloud can dynamically allocate resources to applications within seconds and maintain higher resource utilization in a single container.},
